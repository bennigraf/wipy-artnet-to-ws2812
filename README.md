# wipy-artnet-to-ws2812

Control WS2812 LEDs via Art-Net on a Wipy board. Use the ws2812 driver from https://github.com/Oliv4945/wipy-WS2812. 

This is more of a proof of concept so far and has some flaws:
 * Runs pretty sluggish on probably 2-10 fps, so there's room for improvement. 
 * Ignores the Art-Net net, subnet and universe id so far.
 
 Feel free to submit pull requests!
